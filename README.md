# MT_ButteredBread_Rapunzel
Final project for Media &amp; Technology Spring 2023. Interactive fairy tale, Rapunzel

STORY CONCEPT: Lonely Rapunzel lives in a big tower owned by a mysterious witch with magical flowers. With every other exit securely blocked off, the witch calls out to Rapunzel to let down her long blonde hair so she can climb it. One day, Rapunzel meets a curious prince to which Rapunzel falls in love with. The witch, who becomes very upset that Rapunzel disobeyed her, decides to chop off Rapunzel's hair as the prince is holding onto it and climbing to the balcony. The prince then falls into the thorny bushes and loses his sight. Rapunzel, with now brown, short hair finds that her tears can heal his eyes. Then, they live happily ever after.

Our interactive storytelling enclosure involves four main servos and switches.

Each servo will be triggered by its corresponding switch. The switches and servos listed below:

Switch one will be triggered by a turning disk. When triggered, the hair with a basket is dropped from the tower.

Switch two will be triggered when the prince and Rapunzel meet. This will trigger a servo to pull up a cloud of hearts to show that they are in love.

Switch three will be triggered when the cleaver drops onto the hair. This will trigger a servo to move below the ground and pull a string with a penny weight on the top of the tower.

Switch four will be triggerd then the user pulls a tear drop down attaching the copper tapes. This will trigger a 180 degree box to turn with two faces of the prince: blind and not blind.
